== Containers - WTF
Containers are similar to VMs. But way more efficient.   
VMs share the host systems hardware resources - Containers share the OS kernel.    
Whereas VMs rely on huge bulky diskimages. Containers on the ohter hand focus on code reuse and effeciency.

=== Basic terms
To make talk unambiguous some first terms:
1. Dockerfile - Plaintext file describing the setup, configuration and contents of a docker `Image`
2. Image - Sharable unit of execution in a container context. read only
3. Container - The running `Image`

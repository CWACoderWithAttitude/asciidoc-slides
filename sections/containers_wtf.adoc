== Containers - WTF
Containers are similar to VMs. But way more efficient.   

=== How
VMs share the host systems hardware resources - Containers share the OS kernel.    

=== Comparison
Whereas VMs rely on huge bulky diskimages. Containers on the ohter hand focus on code reuse and effeciency.

=== Use Cases
* Containers are great for running apps in a deterministic environment   
* It's easy to run bunch of interconnected containers   
* Containers can be run without influencing the host system
* Container images are convenient to share

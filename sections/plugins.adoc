== Extra Plugins
We've enabled some plugins 

=== Countdown
I've added the https://github.com/christer79/reveal_countdown[Countdown.js plugin] to add timers to your slides

Time to finish the slide +++<countdown time="60" autostart="yes" />+++

Use `t` to start/stop timer and `+` and `-` to modify time. 

WARNING: `+` and `-` keys are keyboard-specific so you'll need to change them in `docinfo-footer.html`

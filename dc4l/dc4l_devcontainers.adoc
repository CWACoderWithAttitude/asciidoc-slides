== DC4L > Devcontainers
[%step]
* Devconatainers (DCs) is a project invented by MS.
* DCs consist of one or more containers and setup for Visual Studio Code
* For the most part IDE means VS Code. But there's a project to use https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/connect-to-devcontainer.html#create_dev_container_inside_ide[IntelliJ IDEA]
* they're described / configured by files in folder `.devcontainer` in your project.

== Requirements
* VS Code with `ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers`-Plugin - usually bundled with `ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack`
* Local docker environment 
* Honestly: (You don't even need local docker but executing containers on a remote docker host/OpenShift/K8s system is not covered today)

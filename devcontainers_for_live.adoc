== ReCap
* Containers are very resource efficent    
* Containers run code in isolation
* Containers don't clutter your system

== Why 
Shorter test cycles - immediate feedback

[.notes]
****
Testing your code changes before comitting them to git allows for shorter test cycles 
****

== Why develop in Containers
[%step]
* CaC -> Configuration as Code
* Develop in a prod like setup
* Enables you to run your code prod like
* Test your code with prod near setups

=== CaC -> Configuration as Code
[%step]
* No local  install
* All the setup is done in text files. 
* Dev & Test on target env
* Easily to put under SourceControl
* Share yoou exact setup with your m8s
* Repeatable


=== Develop in a prod like setup
* Use local prod DB from day 1 
* Use 

=== Enables you to run your code prod like
* Tools like test containers let you define exact test environments for test execution

=== Test your code with prod like setup


=== Isolated Environments

==== Containers act like very resource efficient virtual machines
The host system and the container share the same kernel 

* Container definitions are e
* Do not clutter your machine
